# Supply-Chain-Issue-Analysis

Codebasics, a renowned YouTuber, initiated a challenge where participants were tasked with creating a dashboard for a supply chain problem based on a conversation between stakeholders and a Data Analyst. Instead of receiving a mock-up, participants had to decipher the requirements from the dialogue and develop a dashboard that not only presented overall insights to stakeholders but also provided insights crucial for resolving the supply chain issue.
